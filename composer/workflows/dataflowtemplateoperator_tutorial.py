"""Example Airflow DAG that creates a Cloud Dataproc cluster, runs the Hadoop
wordcount example, and deletes the cluster.

This DAG relies on three Airflow variables
https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html#variables
* project_id - Google Cloud Project ID to use for the Cloud Dataflow cluster.
* gce_zone - Google Compute Engine zone where Cloud Dataflow cluster should be
  created.
* gce_region - Google Compute Engine region where Cloud Dataflow cluster should be
  created.
Learn more about the difference between the two here:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones
* bucket_name - Google Cloud Storage bucket where you've stored the User Defined
Function (.js), the input file (.txt), and the JSON schema (.json).
